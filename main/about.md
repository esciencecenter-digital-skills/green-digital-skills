## About the Green Digital Skills course

In this course, we want to equip the attendees with
a basic knowledge of the link from digital and computational science to energy consumption, and
eventually equivalent CO2 emissions.

The course material consists of two parts: 
 - a lecture, in three chapters, introducing the general topic of `green` computing
 - a set of hands-on exercises, covering general good practices for software development, and tools for measuring energy and CO2 emissions on your laptop or on HPC clusters 


## Target audience

The target audience for this course includes, but is not limited to, students, reseachers,
data scientists, and IT support staff performing computational science, handling data, or
using/developing scientific software.
