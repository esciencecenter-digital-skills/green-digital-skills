EAR supports the utilization of both mpirun/mpiexec and srun commands.\nTo enable EAR in your job script when launching an MPI application you will need to include the following SBATCH options in your job script.\n\n`srun` is the preferred job launcher when using EAR, as the EARL is a SLURM plugin! You will collect the largest amount of energy metrics when using srun\nRunning MPI applications with EARL is automatic for SLURM systems when using srun. All the jobs are monitored by EAR and the Library is loaded by default when EAR is enabled in the job script. To run a job with srun and EARL there is no need to load the EAR module. When using slurm commands for job submission, both Intel and OpenMPI implementations are supported. When using sbatch/srun or salloc to submit a job, Intel MPI and OpenMPI are supported.\n\n\n### Example usage in a batch script\n\n```\n#SBATCH --ear=on\n#SBATCH --ear-policy=monitoring\n```\n\nExample:\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n \n#SBATCH -p rome\n#SBATCH -t 00:30:00\n#SBATCH --ntasks=128\n \n#SBATCH --ear=on\n#SBATCH --ear-policy=monitoring\n#SBATCH --ear-verbose=1\n \nsrun myapplication\n```\n"},{"_path":"/modules/hpc-handson/further_reading","_dir":"hpc-handson","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Reading material","description":"","type":"reading","order":10,"_type":"markdown","_id":"local_fs:modules:hpc-handson:further_reading.md","_source":"local_fs","_file":"modules/hpc-handson/further_reading.md","_stem":"modules/hpc-handson/further_reading","_extension":"md","plainText":"---\ntitle: Reading material\ntype: reading\norder: 10\n---\n\n# Reading material\n\n* EAR documentation for use on Snellius here: https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62226671\n* EAR full documentation can be found here https://gitlab.bsc.es/ear_team/ear/-/wikis/home\n\n\n"}]
