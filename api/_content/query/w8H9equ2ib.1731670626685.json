The Green Algorithms Calculator was required to be used for the applications. Researchers accepted it was a fair request and still continued applying.\n- If a project is cheap financially, but has a large carbon cost, there should be an explicit justification why\n\nNote:\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### What is too much energy anyway?\n- Do the potential benefits outweigh the environmental costs?\n- **We should think of energy (or CO2) the same way we think of money**\n  - What matters is the _cost-benefit_ ratio\n  - Is €1M a lot? Not if it leads to curing a major disease\n- Currently researchers are used to making the scientific case for the money they request\n- They should also be able to make the case for the corresponding carbon footprint\n- The energy and carbon cost can often be hidden or abstracted from the researcher's perspective\n\nNote:\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Key points\n\n- Carbon intensity has a large spatial and temporal variability\n  - Carbon footprint of data centres anually is roughly the same as the entire US aviation in the same time\n- Several tools and initiatives exist to help with this\n  - Online calculators, carbon estimation tools, certification schemes\n- Cost-benefit analysis is as important as the raw carbon cost\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n"}]
