The command uses EARâ€™s configuration file to determine if the user running it is privileged or not, as non-privileged users can only access their information. It provides the following options. The ear module needs to be loaded to use the eacct command.\n\neacct example usage\nThe basic usage of eacct retrieves the last 20 applications (by default) of the user executing it. The default behavior shows data from each job-step, aggregating the values from each node in said job-step. If using SLURM as a job manager, a sbatch job-step is created with the data from the entire execution. A specific job may be specified with -j option:\n\nDefault: Show the last 20 jobs (maximum) executed by the user.\n```\neacct\n```\nQuery a specific job\n```\neacct -J 123456789\n```\nQuery a specific job-step\n```\neacct -J 123456789.0\n```\nShow metrics (averaged per job.stepid) from 3 jobs\n```\neacct -j 175966,175967,175968\n```\n\n#### Important Options\n - `-l` shows the information for each node for each job instead of the global statistics for said job.\n - `-r` shows the EAR loop signatures. Users, job ids, and step ids can be specified as if were showing job information.\n - `-c` specifies the file where the output will be stored in CSV format. If the argument is \"no_file\" the output will be printed to STDOUT [default: off]\n\n\n### Example:\n\n```\nsqueue\n             JOBID PARTITION     NAME     USER ST       TIME  NODES NODELIST(REASON)\n           2884239      rome ear_sbat benjamic  R       2:19      1 tcn352\n```\n\n```\n[benjamic@int4 EAR]$ eacct -j 2884239\n    JOB-STEP USER       APPLICATION      POLICY NODES AVG/DEF/IMC(GHz) TIME(s)    POWER(W) GBS     CPI   ENERGY(J)    GFLOPS/W IO(MBs) MPI%  G-POW (T/U)   G-FREQ  G-UTIL(G/MEM)\n2884239-sb   benjamic   ear_sbatch_GROMA MO     1     2.57/2.60/---    386.00     596.51   ---     ---   230253       ---      ---     ---   ---           ---     ---          \n2884239-0    benjamic   ear_sbatch_GROMA MO     1     2.57/2.60/1.47   348.64     617.18   8.33    0.33  215175       0.2930   0.3     77.6  0.00/---      ---     --- \n```\n\n### Application Characterization\n\nEAR is not only a tool that will throttle CPU Freqs, but it also allows you to collect \"traces\" of your application, and characterize it. This is especially handy for large many node jobs, that often prove difficult to profile. In this way EAR is also a \"light-weight\" profiler for large applications.\n\nThe image below illustrates the usage of EAR to show the characteristics of a variety of multi-node CPU based applications side by side. This information can be obtained via the `monitoring` policy in EAR, and visualized with the `eacct` tool.\n\n![Application_char](media/CPU_characterization_plot.png)\n"},{"_path":"/modules/introduction-handson/ex_workfloor","_dir":"introduction-handson","_draft":false,"_partial":false,"_locale":"","title":"Green workplace","description":"While this workshop is a lot about optimizing the use of computers for sustainability, there is much more to sustainability than that.

Global warming is not only a technical problem, it is also one of habits and consumption.\n\n1. Think about your day to day work environment and think how you can make your workplace more environmentally sustainable. Think out of the box. \n2. Write down some action points\n3. Discuss with your neighbour and steal any points that you think are relevant to your workplace. \n4. Pick one item from the list, which might be feasible to achieve next week. \n5. Commit to it! \n\n<small>\nSome suggestions:\n\n- Policies at work regarding environmental sustainability, are there any and if so, are they good enough?\n- Go to work by bike/public transport instead of by car\n- Rethink your presence at scientific conferences, if you need to go, can you travel by train instead of airplane?\n- What bank/energe provider/insurrance company does your organization use? Can you make them switch to a more sustainable option?\n- How is catering arranged? Are there enough plant based options? Some organizations decide to only serve plant based food, is this an option?\n\n</small>\n\nPS. You can do the same for your personal home environment!"}]
