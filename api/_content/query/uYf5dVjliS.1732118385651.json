Without proper (automated) testing, documentation and sharing, resources are wasted constantly. \n\nExamples are:\n- running (and failing) untested or badly tested workflows in high-resource jobs\n- having to redo a lot of work because things are lost as they were not stored/versioned properly\n- having to redo someone elses work because it was not properly published or licensed\n\n[CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org/) is a very good resource for learning best practices in programming and data management for research software. Their [full blown course](https://coderefinery.org/lessons/) lasts 6 days and goes fairly deep into the most important aspects of software development. \n\nThe [“CodeRefinery in 1 hour” course](https://coderefinery.github.io/research-software-engineering/) condenses most of the materials in a 1 hours crash-course. For this exercise we will follow the contents of this crash course.

These materials are less hands-on because they are made for research supporters, however they often give you a nice conceptual overview of the concepts. You can regard these as optional additional materials. \n\n## 0.
