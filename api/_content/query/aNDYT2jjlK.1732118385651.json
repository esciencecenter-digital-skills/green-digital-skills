manufacturing, more transistor/surface (Moore's law)\n - low level instructions handling improvements\n - increase in CPU clock rate (until mid-2000)\n\nNote:\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### What does it mean for energy ?\n - More transistors lead to more power, but smaller transistors need less voltage \n - CPU have a baseline (idle) power consumption ($P_0$), due to current leakage, unless closing circuit totally\n - Active power consumption of CPUs: `$$ \\sim P_0 + C * V(f)^2 * f \\sim f^3 $$`\n    - $f$: clock rate\n    - $V$: voltage, higher voltage needed with higher clockrate to transfer information faster\n - Energy: power * time, time needed $1/f$ (fixed number of operations) ->\n    `$$ E \\sim f^2 $$`\n    \nNote:\n\nThis may seem like a lot of detail.\nWhat really matters here is understanding that the energy usage of the CPU is influenced by the clock rate (frequency).\nIncreases in clock rate cause a disproportionate increase in energy usage (since f is squared)\n\n===\n\n<!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n### Computer performances: FLOPs/Watt\n\n<div style=\"width: 40%; float: right\">\n\n* Raw FLOPs
