Energy mix different at different times\n- Interesting new tools such as Carbon Aware Task Scheduler (UK-only currently)\n  - Tells you what is the best time to run in the next 48 hours\n- Think about what resources you request\n  - Number of CPU cores is clearly a large contributor\n  - Carbon footprint of memory is interesting - it doesn't matter how much you use, but how much is available. Don't request 10 times the memory you need on a server \"just in case\"\n\nNote:\nCarbon awareness image is from <https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk>.\n\nMost jobs have some flexibility - we don't care if we run it right now or in a few hours.
