This is intended to raise awareness of environmental issues relating to research computing, providing some best practices in green coding and exploring a range of solutions to profile and reduce energy usage for different kinds of common workflows.\n\nThe website with this lesson material can be found here: <https://esciencecenter-digital-skills.github.io/green-digital-skills/>\n\n## Target audience\nThe current lesson material is being developed for a pilot workshop at the Prinses MÃ¡xima Centrum.\n\n## Technical documentation\nThis platform uses the [NEBULA framework](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA).\n\nFor elaborate setup instructions and other documentation, see the [NEBULA documentation](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA-docs)\n\n## Quick local setup\n\nMore detailed information about local setup can be found in the [NEBULA local rendering docs](https://github.com/esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA-docs/blob/main/local-rendering.md)\n\n### Content directory/repository\n\nTo use NEBULA to build the content in this repository locally, you will need to clone this repository and the NEBULA repository:\n\n```bash\ngit clone git@github.com:esciencecenter-digital-skills/green-digital-skills.git\ngit clone git@github.com:esciencecenter-digital-skills/NEBULA.git\n```\n\n### Link to the content repository\n\nTo make sure that NEBULA knows where to find the content, we create the following environment variable:\n\n```bash\nexport CONTENT_PATH=\"~/path/to/your/content/repository\"\n```\n\n### Install dependencies\n\nInstall the dependencies using the [node package manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm):\n\n```bash\n# node package manager\nnpm install\n```\n\n### Local development build\n\nStart the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:\n\n```bash\n# node package manager\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nNow you can open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/green-digital-skills`\n"}]
