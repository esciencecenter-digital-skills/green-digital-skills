### ICT under scrutiny

<div style="width: 40%; float: left; margin-top: 1%">

* Information Computing Technology (ICT) 
* Predicted major increase in electricity demand:
- from 8% to 21% in 2030.

* Responsible for about 2% of global CO2 emmisions, on par with the aviation sector.

</div>

<div style="width: 60%; float: right">
<img src="media/ICT_EnergyConsumption_Jones_2018.png" width="100%")
</div>

Note:

On the graph:
 - 4 components to ICT demand: network infra., consumer device (not including IoT-connected devices), data center and production from first three components (cradle-to-gate)
 - this is an expected prediction, best and worst case scenario are 12% and 50%, resp.

As researchers we use devices (laptops, workstations), local/national clusters (e.g. Snellius) and cloud services (SURF Cloud, AWS, ...).
Our day2day work embedded in ICT.

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## Overall contribution of ICT

- Computing carbon footprint can be split into two main contributions:
  - *Embodied*: from raw material extraction, to distribution
  - *Usage*: Powering, memory, infrastructure

Note:

===


<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### Data centers

<div style="width: 40%; float: right">

* Compute and/or storage
* Efficiency characterized by Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE)
- PUE = P_{total_facility} / P_{IT_facility}

* Quantifies overhead. Gives you e.g. how much cooling power you need per unit of compute
* Best data centers are now down to about 10% extra for cooling, but still large variability. Used to be around 100%.

</div>


<div style="width: 60%; float: left; margin-top: 1%">

</div>

Note:
 - P_{IT_facility} in PUE not limited to CPU/GPU, also include network, memory storage, backups, ...

## _Where is the energy going?_

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### What is using the energy?

<div style="width: 40%; float: left; margin-top: 1%">

* Devices are powered by electricity.
* Electrons themselves are used to perform the operations encoded in your softwares.
* Number of operations processors can crunch per second has continuously increased.

</div>

<div style="width: 60%; float: right">

![Consumer CPU performances](media/CPUFlops_overTime.png)

</div>

Note:

Over the past 40 years, the number of operations processors
can crunch per second has continuously increased

Figure: consumer CPU performances over 40 years (relative). (Hennessy J. and Patterson D. A., Computer Architecture (5th edition)) 

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### Supercomputers are also doing more

![TOP500 GFLOPS](media/top500_performance_evolution.svg)

Note:

This trend extends to supercomputers (e.g. Snellius) and data centers. Top500 records performances
of the world's (500) biggest computers on the same problem for over 30 years:

Initially growth faster than Moore's law, but slowing down past 2013. Switch to GPUs around 2019
kept the curve on track with Moore's law even though transitor/surface is increasing slower than Moore's law.

Figure: now showing GFLOPs, blue biggest supercomputer, red average of the 500.

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### CPU energy consumption: how does it relate to FLOPs ?

Increase in FLOPs mostly related to:
 - improved manufacturing, more transistor/surface (Moore's law)
 - low level instructions handling improvements
 - increase in CPU clock rate (until mid-2000)

Note:

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### What does it mean for energy ?
 - More transistors lead to more power, however smaller transistors need less voltage 
 - CPU have a baseline (idle) power consumption (P_0), due to current leakage, unless closing circuit totally
 - Active power consumption of CPUs: ~ P_0 + C * V(f_c)^2 * f_c ~ f_c^3
    f_c: clock rate
    V: voltage, higher voltage needed with higher clockrate to transfer information faster
 - Energy: power * time, time needed 1/f_c (fixed number of operations) -> energy ~ f_c^2
    
Note:

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### Computer performances: FLOPs/Watt

<div style="width: 40%; float: right">

* Raw FLOPs data are not an appropriate measure of how efficient a CPU (or GPU) is.
* The 10^8 increase in FLOPs does not translate to needing a nuclear power plant to run Snellius.
* Green500 ranks the Top500 supercomputer based on their power consumption since 2014.
Compared to Koomey's prediction: factor 2 improvement every 1.57 years.

## _What does this mean for carbon production?_

===


<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## Energy Carbon intensity
- Carbon intensity has a large spatial and temporal variability.
- Extreme differences between countries
- Countries with very low carbon intensity (e.g. Norway): 20g per kWh
- Countries with high carbon intensity (e.g. Australia): 700g per kWh
- You can make a big difference by running the exact same thing on the same hardware, but in a different country

Note:

So far, we've talked about energy -> a proxy for CO2 emission, using the energy carbon intensity

# Typical footprint
- Carbon footprint of data centres anually is around 100 MT of CO2 equivalent
  - That is the same as the entire US aviation in the same time.
  - Not all these data centres are doing HPC
- About 500 Tonnes of CO2 estimated for training GPT3
  - IPC says we should aim for 2 tonnes of CO2 per person per year to keep global warming in check. 
  - Not every model has such huge impacts, but we need to be mindful

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## _What can we do about it?_

Note:

There are many tools and initiatives aimed at dealing with these issues

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## Estimating impact
- Lo√Øc Lannelongue started a project called Green Algorithms: 
- Made a calculator to estimate energy cost and carbon footprint of your algorithm
- Necessary for assessing how to make computing more environmentally sustainable

Note:

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## The GREENER framework
- A set of principles for green computing analogous to the FAIR principles for data
- GREENER:
  - **G**overnance
  - **R**esponsibility
  - **E**stimations: Use calculators to estimate impact of the computing
  - **N**ew collaboration
  - **E**ducation: Need to include the notion that it has a carbon footprint during training of new researchers
  - **R**esearch: Still don't know a lot about computing power usage

Note:

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## The online calculator

</div>


<div style="width: 40%; float: right; margin-top: 1%">

- The Green Algorithms online calculator makes it quick and easy to estimate the carbon footprint
- Can be found here: <http://calculator.green-algorithms.org/>
- There is also a Green Algorithms tool for HPC

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## _Will these things help?_

Note:

Some practical considerations to discuss

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

## Yet more paperwork?

- Is this just more work for researchers when filling out grant applications?
- All applications must estimate the environmental impact of their models.
- They did this in France and researchers still applied. The Green Algorithms Calculator was required to be used for the applications. Researchers accepted it was a fair request and still continued applying.
- If a project is cheap financially, but has a large carbon cost, there should be an explicit justification why

Note:

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### What is too much energy anyway?
- Do the potential benefits outweigh the environmental costs?
- **We should think of energy (or CO2) the same way we think of money**
  - What matters is the _cost-benefit_ ratio
  - Is ‚Ç¨1M a lot? Not if it leads to curing a major disease
- Currently researchers are used to making the scientific case for the money they request
- They should also be able to make the case for the corresponding carbon footprint
- The energy and carbon cost can often be hidden or abstracted from the researcher's perspective
