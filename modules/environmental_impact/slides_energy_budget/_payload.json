Not if it leads to curing a major disease\n- Currently researchers are used to making the scientific case for the money they request\n- They should also be able to make the case for the corresponding carbon footprint\n- The energy and carbon cost can often be hidden or abstracted from the researcher's perspective\n\nNote:\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Estimating impact\n- Loïc Lannelongue started a project called Green Algorithms: \n- Made a calculator to estimate energy cost and carbon footprint of your algorithm\n- Necessary for assessing how to make computing more environmentally sustainable\n\nNote:\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## The GREENER framework\n- A set of principles for green computing analogous to the FAIR principles for data\n- GREENER:\n  - **G**overnance\n  - **R**esponsibility\n  - **E**stimations: Use calculators to estimate impact of the computing\n  - **N**ew collaboration\n  - **E**ducation: Need to include the notion that it has a carbon footprint during training of new researchers\n  - **R**esearch: Still don't know a lot about computing power usage\n\nNote:\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## The online calculator\n\n\u003Cimg src=\"media/green-algorithms-calculator-example.png\" />\n\n- The Green Algorithms online calculator makes it quick and easy to estimate the carbon footprint\n- Can be found here: \u003Chttp://calculator.green-algorithms.org/>\n- There is also a Green Algorithms tool for HPC\n\nNote:\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"empty-slide\" data-background-iframe=\"http://calculator.green-algorithms.org/\" -->\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"standard\" -->\n\n## Yet more paperwork?\n\n- Is this just more work for researchers when filling out grant applications?\n- All applications must estimate the environmental impact of their models.\n- They did this in France and researchers still applied. The Green Algorithms Calculator was required to be used for the applications. Researchers accepted it was a fair request and still continued applying.\n- If a project is cheap financially, but has a large carbon cost, there should be an explicit justification why\n\nNote:\n\n===\n\n\u003C!-- .slide: data-state=\"keepintouch\" -->\n\nwww.esciencecenter.nl\n\ninfo@esciencecenter.nl\n\n020 - 460 47 70\n",[1154,1189],{"_path":1155,"_dir":1156,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":1157,"description":7,"body":1158,"_type":1147,"_id":1186,"_source":1149,"_file":1187,"_extension":1151,"plainText":1188},"/main/about","main","About",{"type":13,"children":1159,"toc":1182},[1160,1166,1171,1177],{"type":16,"tag":29,"props":1161,"children":1163},{"id":1162},"about-this-lessonproject",[1164],{"type":22,"value":1165},"About this lesson/project",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":1167,"children":1168},{},[1169],{"type":22,"value":1170},"Provide details about the project and lesson.",{"type":16,"tag":29,"props":1172,"children":1174},{"id":1173},"target-audience",[1175],{"type":22,"value":1176},"Target audience",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":1178,"children":1179},{},[1180],{"type":22,"value":1181},"Define target audience for this material.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":11,"depth":11,"links":1183},[1184,1185],{"id":1162,"depth":11,"text":1165},{"id":1173,"depth":11,"text":1176},"local_fs:main:about.md","main/about.md","---\ntitle: About\n---\n\n## About this lesson/project\n\nProvide details about the project and lesson.\n\n## Target audience\n\nDefine target audience for this material.",{"_path":1190,"_dir":1156,"_draft":6,"_partial":6,"_locale":7,"title":1191,"description":7,"body":1192,"_type":1147,"_id":1208,"_source":1149,"_file":1209,"_extension":1151,"plainText":1210},"/main/contribute","Contribute",{"type":13,"children":1193,"toc":1205},[1194,1200],{"type":16,"tag":29,"props":1195,"children":1197},{"id":1196},"contributing-to-this-lesson",[1198],{"type":22,"value":1199},"Contributing to this lesson",{"type":16,"tag":24,"props":1201,"children":1202},{},[1203],{"type":22,"value":1204},"Add contributing guidelines for you project.",{"title":7,"searchDepth":11,"depth":11,"links":1206},[1207],{"id":1196,"depth":11,"text":1199},"local_fs:main:contribute.md","main/contribute.md","---\ntitle: Contribute\n---\n\n## Contributing to this lesson\n\nAdd contributing guidelines for you project.",1718960914859]
