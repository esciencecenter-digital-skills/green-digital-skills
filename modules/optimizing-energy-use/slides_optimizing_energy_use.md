# Optimizing Energy Use in Practice

===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### What we will cover here
- What software development choices can reduce energy wastage
- How can we measure the actual energy usage of our code


===

<!-- .slide: data-state="standard" -->

### Good software practice

Clean and maintainable software is essential
for sustainable/green software:
 - Ease of use, reduce error during data settings
 - Less bugs, avoid wasteful bugged runs

Note:

### Software life cycle

- Thinking about long term sustainability, documentation.
- Reusable software is a key component of modern
software development, reducing the time/energy consuming
task of developing every component of complex softwares.

### What language should I use?
- Typical conception of energy efficiency:
  - C++ and Rust at the top
  - Python and R at the bottom
- There is a lot of truth in this but there are a lot of important considerations
- **Many major numerical libraries in Python are not Python "under the surface"**
  - The core is usually C++ or something like that.
  - e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow, numpy (and many others)

### Use the right tool for each task

- Should I avoid "slow" and inefficient programming languages?
- Well, each has its purpose
  - Python: great for stitching pieces together, easy prototyping
  - C/C++/Fortran: better at crunching numbers fast
- Language benchmarks available in the literature can be misleading here
  - Python/R for can be fine, it's more about the libraries you are using

### What software should we optimize?
- **It is important that frequently used tools are as efficient as possible**
- Your single-use analysis scripts probably don't matter so much - just use the easiest language for the job
- Optimization is not free and costs development time (and energy) especially in lower level languages like C
- Generally there are not enough RSEs to do all the coding and optimizations, and researchers don't have time

### Minimizing energy use
- Ultimately depends on the resources you use
- Number of CPU cores is clearly a large contributor
- Carbon footprint of memory is interesting - it doesn't matter how much you use, but how much is available. Don't request 10 times the memory you need on a server "just in case"
- Think about WHEN we run a job on a server. Energy mix different at different times.
- Can use tools such as the Carbon Aware Task Scheduler - tells you what is the best time to run in the next 48 hours.
- Most jobs have some flexibility - we don't care if we run it right now or in a few hours. Especially over the weekend.

### Time to solution

- Energy is Power * time
- As a first approximation, more efficient (faster) software will be energy efficient
  - It is possible to run on many CPUs although there is overhead from the parallelism.

Note:

===

### Profile your code

- We recommend trying `CodeCarbon`
  - More in this afternoon's hands-on workshop
- Also PMT (Power Measurement Toolkit), Rjoules, and many more

### What if I can't/won't change the code?

- Perhaps you can profile the code but you cannot do much with the results
  - e.g. You are not the developer, or don't feel experienced enough
- There are tools such as the Energy Aware Runtime
  - Dynamically scales the CPU or GPU clock frequency up or down while the code is running
  - When code is waiting a lot (for I/O or memory), frequency is scaled down
  - Remember that Power ~ frequency^2
  - Also covered in this afternoon's hands-on workshop (HPC-track)

### A warning: Jevon's Paradox

```
In economics, the Jevons paradox occurs when technological progress increases
the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary for any one use),
but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased,
rather than reduced.
```

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox)

* Are you thinking about this the right way?
* Is green computing really a purely technical issue?
* Is your footprint by computing really your biggest contribution to the climate crisis?
* What are other low hanging fruits you can tackle?

Note:
In practice, reducing energy use overall is more about organizational policy and value judgements about what the expected return is for a given amount of energy used.
