### Before we start

- You are a diverse crowd!
- No one-size-fits-all approach to going green
- This is a broad and high-level introduction to a broad, deep area
- We want to help you find the aspect you are interested in and get you set up

Note:

We have people who maybe do data analysis, some scripting (R, Python?) but also others launching some much more complex bioinformatics workflows, and submitting jobs to HPC (either your local cluster or Snellius)

We have tried to include something for everyone here, to get you started with where to go for further expertise

For the technical aspects there are many good (but much longer) courses available that go into this in depth

We also give best practices that you might not have considered, or discussion points regarding the need for policy
We want you to get set up with the tools you might need and know where to look to pursue that further

### Why do we care?

Note:
At eScience Center we have many projects concerning environmental destruction due to climate change.
We all have expertise in HPC and (computationally) efficient computing so the energy aspects are increasingly interesting to us too.
